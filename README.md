# hello-world


Hey folks. My name is Chris. I'm teaching myself javascript and data science. I'm a graphic designer by training, and I'm also into illustration, writing, storytelling and radio journalism. w00t!

My Hello World repository. I did this once! A long time ago! Now I'm making a new branch and committing a new change as a refresher.
