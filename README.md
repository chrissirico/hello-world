# hello-world

Hey folks. My name is Chris. I'm teaching myself javascript and other front-endsy things in hopes of making some money in web development. Thinking about playing with some Python as well.

I'm a graphic designer by training, and I'm also into illustration, writing, storytelling and radio journalism. w00t!
